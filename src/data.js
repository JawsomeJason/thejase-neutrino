The attention to detail that he shows makes the difference between a decent site and a stellar one. And despite not taking the shortcuts that less experienced developers are often tempted to take, he is quite efficient and productive. Net result: A well-executed, no-compromises product. \n\nSome more facts:\n1. Two of our best developers told me they joined the company specifically for the chance to work with Jason after interviewing with him. That's the kind of respected leader he is.\n2. Jason's skill with responsive web design is second to none. His philosophy about how the Web was meant to be used dovetails perfectly with responsive design.\n3. Jason can explain any UX concept thoughtfully and in detail to help inform a design or implementation. His passion here really shows.\n\nIn conclusion, I have complete confidence in recommending Jason for any team which would benefit from an elite front-end or UX engineer.",
