He has a deep respect for product, design and his colleagues in engineering, which made working with him a true pleasure. He was very thoughtful in everything he implemented and always made sure to align his time with the business priorities.',

    content: "Jason is hands down the best front-end engineer that I've had the pleasure of working with. He brings valuable and well rounded insight to every project. From consumer facing UX/UI to backend efficiencies no detail is over looked nor is any decision left unconsidered. His attention to design specs makes any designer's heart melt with happiness. He is an excellent written and verbal communicator, making him an ideal candidate to work cross-departmentally. Working with him in such a manor often leads to end results that surpass anyones or one departments expectations.\n\nI would recommend working with Jason on any level... I in fact wish that all front end developers had the 'can-do' attitude and keen eye that he possess.",

    content: "Jason is one of the most talented and knowledgeable front-end engineers I've ever met and had the pleasure to work with. He is an authoritative source of information, as well as a tireless problem-solver. I worked closely with Jason in the design of several major projects, and consulted him often on other projects. Jason's architecture is clean and efficient, and he always designs with best practices in mind, never compromising performance, accessibility or usability. The attention to detail that he shows makes the difference between a decent site and a stellar one. And despite not taking the shortcuts that less experienced developers are often tempted to take, he is quite efficient and productive. Net result: A well-executed, no-compromises product. \n\nSome more facts:\n1. Two of our best developers told me they joined the company specifically for the chance to work with Jason after interviewing with him. That's the kind of respected leader he is.\n2. Jason's skill with responsive web design is second to none. His philosophy about how the Web was meant to be used dovetails perfectly with responsive design.\n3. Jason can explain any UX concept thoughtfully and in detail to help inform a design or implementation. His passion here really shows.\n\nIn conclusion, I have complete confidence in recommending Jason for any team which would benefit from an elite front-end or UX engineer.",
